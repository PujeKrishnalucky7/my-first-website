       <h1>GitHub faces widespread malware attacks<br>affecting projects, including crypto</h1>
       <p> developer who found the vulnerability requested developers sign their revisions with<br>the GPG key to ensure all their revisions on the project can be verified.</p>

<p>
    Major developer platform GitHub faced a widespread malware attack and reported 35,000<br> “code hits” on a day that saw thousands of Solana-based wallets drained for millions of<br>dollars.

</p>
<p>
    The widespread attack was highlighted by GitHub developer Stephen Lucy, who first<br>reported the incident earlier on Wednesday.The developer came across the issue while<br>reviewing a project he found on a Google search.

</p>
<p>So far, various projects — from crypto, Golang, Python, JavaScript, Bash, Docker and<br> Kubernetes — have been found to be affected by the attack. The malware attack is<br> targeted at the docker images, install docs and NPM script, which is a convenient way<br> to bundle common shell commands for a project.</p>

<p>To dupe developers and access critical data, the attacker first creates a fake <br>repository (a repository contains all of the project’s files and each file’s revision<br> history and pushes clones of legit projects to GitHub. For example, the following two<br> snapshots show this legit crypto miner project and its clone.

<p>Many of these clone repositories were pushed as “pull requests,” which let<br> developers tell others about changes they have pushed to a branch in a repository on<br> GitHub.</p>

<p>Once the developer falls prey to the malware attack, the entire environment variable<br> (ENV) of the script, application or laptop (Electron apps) is sent to the attacker’s<br> server. The ENV includes security keys, Amazon Web Services access keys, crypto<br> keys and much more.</p>

<P>The developer has reported the issue to GitHub and advised developers to GPG-sign<br> their revisions made to the repository. GPG keys add an extra layer of security to<br> GitHub accounts and software projects by providing a way of verifying all revisions<br> come from a trusted source.</P>
